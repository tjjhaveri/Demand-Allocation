# Demand-Allocation

Each quarter, Component GSMs need to perform sourcing allocation tasks. For each component(Customer Part Number), GSMs will decide:

1. which CMs are awarded?

2. what percentage is each CM awarded?

It is time-consuming for such a task due to the nature of thousands of components and dozens of suppliers may be involved in each allocation. 
Especially we are working towards improving supply chain robustness and localization. 
This optimization model is a quick allocation solver for relieving GSM from manual work; 
However, GSMs still need to take responsibility for checking and finalizing the allocation result.
